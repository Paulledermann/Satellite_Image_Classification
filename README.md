# Satellite_Image_Classification
This notebook explores the classification of satellite images using deep learning techniques. The dataset includes images from two satellite sources: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The goal is to build separate models for each satellite and then combine their predictions for improved classification accuracy
